=================

As announced [here](http://www.318.com/2014/01/introducing-jssimporter-for-autopkg/), the file in this repo is an add-on to the [autopkg project](http://autopkg.github.io/autopkg/).

Installation
=================

INSTALL THE AUTOPKG TOOLS (and recipes) FIRST! (Sorry to yell.) Then use the releases tab, to the right above, to download a package that will install the latest release version for you.

Comments/Questions/Ideas
=================

Please share "ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports, or complaints..." ([source](https://github.com/logstash/logstash#contributing)) by either using [issues in this repo](https://github.com/arubdesu/jss-autopkg-addon/issues), or by contacting me in ##osx-server IRC(Allister) or on twitter, [@sacrilicious](https://twitter.com/Sacrilicious) or my email(shouldn't be too hard to find, try [the MacEnterprise list](http://www.macenterprise.org/mailing-list)). 

Please be so kind as to not report issues in the main autopkg/autopkg repo at this time! Thanks for trying it, and again, any contributions are welcome.
